CTF Nahamcon 2024
Challenge Name: Base3200

This challenge required the user to download a very large file from the challenge site (about 79MB)
On dumping out the first and last 100 bytes of the file using the commands "heads -c 100" and "tails -c 100",
it was observed that the file is encoded with Base64 encoding scheme. 

The name of the challenge gives the hint: 3200/64 = 50
Therefore the reason the file was so big because it was compressed and encoded 50 iterations of Base64.
This script was coded in python to decode Base64 encoded file if similar challenge is encountered in 
the future. 

Features: Takes in user input for the number of iterations and write decoded output to file
Usage: python3 main.py encoded_file
